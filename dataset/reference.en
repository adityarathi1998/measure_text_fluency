When I had twenty, I saw my first customers like a psychotherapist.
I was the thesis student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
Elle, c'était une femme de 26 ans appelée Alex.
When Alex entered for his first session, she was wearing jeans and a great top too broad, she dropped on the couch of my office, kidnapped her shoes and told me she was here to talk Boys' problems.
When I heard that, I was so relieved.
My classmate had had a pyromane as the first patient.
And I had a 20 year old girl and some who wanted to talk about boys.
I thought I could handle that.
But I did not manage it.
With the fun stories that Alex brought back during the sessions, it was easy for me to simply nod when we pushed the problem.
"Thirty, it's the new twenties," said Alex, and, for what I knew, she was right.
The work comes later, the wedding arrives later, the children arrive later, even death arrives later.
Young people in the twenties like Alex and I had all life before us.
But shortly after, my thesis director pushed me to question Alex on his love life.
I protested.
I said, "Yes, she goes out with idiots, she layers with a moron, but it's not that she will marry her. »
So my director responded, "Not yet, but she could marry the next.
In addition, the best time to prepare Alex's wedding is before it does it. »
This is what psychologists call the moment of revelation.
This is the moment I realized that thirties is not twenty.
Yes, people are camping later than before, but it's not about twenty Alex a dead time for his development.
It's twenty Alex the best time for his development, and we were sitting there to ruin him.
It was at this moment that I understood that this harmless negligence was a real problem and that he had real consequences, not only for Alex and his sentimental life but for careers, families and the future of all the people in their twenties.
There are currently 50 million people in the twenty in the United States.
That is about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if we consider that no one comes from adulthood without first coming out of his 20 years.
Raise your hand, if you have twenty.
I would really like to see some here.
Oh yeah! You are awesome.
If you work with people in their twenties, if you like a person in their twenties if you lose sleep because of people in their twenties, I want to see - OK. Great, twenty-year-olds really matter.
I specialized within twenty years because I believe that each of these 50 million young people deserves what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists already know: assume his twenties is one of the things. Simpler, but also the most processed, we can live for his work, his love life, his happiness and perhaps even the world.
It's not my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the most decisive moments of a life take place before 35 years.
It means that 8 of the 10 decisions, experiences and revelations that make a life what it will take place from here the middle of the thirties.
You people over 40, do not panic.
This audience will get out of it, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the salary we will win.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, live or go out with their future partner before their 30 years.
We know that the brain finishes its second and ultimate growth pushing in the twenties while it is re-adulted for adulthood, which means that all we want to change in itself, it is now that it takes do it.
We know that the personality changes more during the twenties than any other moment of life, and we know that the peak of fertility in women takes place at 28 years, and that things get complicated after 35 years.
So twenty is the time to learn about his body and options.
So when we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first 5 years are a critical period for language and connections in the brain.
This is the moment when everyday life has an extraordinary impact on that or the one we will become.
But what we hear less about, is that there is what is called an adult development, and that our twenties is the critical period of adult development.
But that's not what young adults hear.
The newspapers speak out of phases of maturity.
Researchers call 20 years, prolonged teenager.
Journalists give stupid nicknames to those who have twenty as "twixters" or "adultscent".
It's true.
Culturally, we have trivialized what is actually the primordial decade of adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that to do great things, you have to have a plan and not enough time.
Is not it true ?
What do you think it happens when, by passing your hand in the hair, it is said to a young of twenty years "You still have 10 years to start your life? »
Nothing happens.
This person has been deprived of his impatience and ambition, and nothing happens.
And then, every day, smart people, interesting like you or as your sons and girls arrive in my office and say things like: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me but this relationship is It's not important. I'm just spending time. »
Or they say, "Everyone says that as long as I start my career from here my 30 years, it will go. »
But then it starts to look like this: "My twenty is almost over, and I did not accomplish anything.
I had a better CV in the aftermath of my university degree. »
And then it starts to look like this: "Going out at 20 years, it was like playing musical chairs.
Everyone turned around and had fun, but then around 30 years old, it's as if the music stopped and everyone began to sit down.
I did not want to be the last standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the chair closest to me at 30 years old. »
Where are people who are twenty here?
Do not do that.
Ok, it looks a little light, but do not deceive yourself, the stakes are very important.
When one pushes a lot of things until thirties, we start pressure to take off his career, to settle, to set up, have 2 or 3 children in an even shorter period.
Many of these things are incompatible, as research begins to show it, simply more difficult and stressful to do suddenly during the thirties.
The post-millennium quarantine crisis is not to buy a red sports car.
It is to realize that we can not have the career we want now.
It is to realize that we can not have the children we want now, or can not be a brother or sister to his child.
Locked too many thirties and quadmenwood look at each other, then look at me on the other side of this room, talk about their twenty years and say, "What did I do? What did I think?
I want to change what people from their twenties are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about what can happen.
This is the story of a woman called Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office because she had, according to her own words, a crisis of identity.
She said she thought she would like to work in the arts or show, but she had not decided yet, so she had spent the last few years as a waitress.
Because it was cheaper, she lived with her boyfriend who had her bad character more often than her ambitions.
And although his twenty has been difficult, his childhood had been even more.
She often cried during our sessions, but then she recovered, saying, "We do not choose his family but you can choose his friends. »
Then one day, Emma came in, she put her head on her knees and sobbed for almost every hour.
She had just bought a new address book, and had spent the morning filling with her numerous contacts, but then she had remained to observe this white page that there is after the words "in case of emergency Please call ... "
She was almost hysterical when she looked at me and said, "Who will be there for me if I have a car accident?
Who will take care of me if I have cancer? »
And at that moment, it took me all my will to say, "I will do it"
But what Emma needed, it was not a psychic that felt really really concerned.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew it was his luck.
I had learned too much since the first time I had worked with Alex to stay sitting there to look at the decisive decade of Emma pass before me.
So during the following weeks and months, I told Emma here are three things that every bit of twenty, man or woman, deserves to hear.
First of all, I told Emma to forget his crisis of identity but to have a capital of identity.
By having identity capital, I mean doing something that adds value to the person we are.
Doing something that is an investment for the person we want to be after.
I did not know what the future career of Emma, ​​no one knows his professional future, but I know this: the identity capital generates the identity capital.
It is now that this work must be applied at the other end of the country, this internship, this start-up one wants to try.
I do not neglect here the exploratory experiences of people in the twenties but I have those who are supposed to not be important those which, moreover, are not exploratory experiences.
It's procrastination.
I told Emma to explore the work track and make it count.
Secondly, I told Emma that the urban tribe was surfing.
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but young people with twenty-year-old people have the same conceptions limit those they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work.
This new share of capital, this new person with whom go out almost always from outside the restricted circle.
New products come from what we call our weak links, friends of friends of friends.
So yes, half of young people in their twenties are unemployed or underemployed.
But half is not, and weak links are one way to enter this group yourself.
Half of the new positions are never published, so come into contact with the boss of his neighbor is the way we will get this post unpublished.
It's not cheat. It is the science of diffusion of information.
Finally and above all, Emma believed that we can not choose his family, but we can choose his friends.
It was true during his childhood but once in the twenties, soon Emma would choose his family when she started in a relationship with someone and would create his own family.
I told Emma that it was now that we had to start choosing his family.
Certainly, it is likely that thirties is actually a better age to hide than 20 or even 25 years, and I agree with you.
But attrapper the one or the one with whom one lives or one lay down by chance at the moment when you lay down where all his friends on facebook start to go to the town hall, it is not going a front.
The best time to prepare his wedding is before, it means being as reflected in love as in his work.
Choosing his family consists of choosing conscientiously who and what we want rather than killing the time and to accommodate him or the one who by chance will have chosen you.
So what happened to Emma?
Well, she opened her address book, and she found a cousin of an old roommate who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
This work gave him a good reason to leave this boyfriend with which she lived.
Now, five years later, she works in events for museums.
She married a man she chose carefully.
She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, "Now the space for emergency contacts does not seem large enough. »
Certainly the story of Emma can give to believe that it's simple, but that's what I like with people in their twenties.
They are so easy to help.
People in their twenties are like aircraft that take off from Los Angeles, en route to the west.
Just after take-off, a slight change of trajectory makes they land in Alaska rather than to Fiji.
Similarly, at 21 or 25, or even 29 years, a good conversation, a stroke of luck, a good TED conference can have a huge impact for the years and even future generations.
So that's an idea that deserves to be broadcast to all young youth you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
This is what I now have the pleasure of saying every day to the people of twenty years like Emma: Thirty is not new twenties, assume your adult age, gain identity capital, use your weak links , choose your family.
Do not be defined by what you did not know or did not do.
You decide your life right now.
Thank you.
Throughout the history of computing, we have struggled to bridge the gap between us and the digital world, the gap between our physical world and the world behind our screen where our imagination can flourish.
This gap has become thinner, even thinner, ever thinner, and now it has become finer than a millimeter, the thickness of a touch screen. The power of computer science is now accessible to all.
But I wondered: and if there could be no limit?
I started to imagine what it could look like.
First, I created this tool that enters the digital space. When you press the screen, it transfers its physical material into pixels.
Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can train on virtual organs under the screen.
With this tool, the border has been crossed.
But our two hands still stay out of the screen.
How can we enter inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of our hands?
At Microsoft Applied Sciences, with my Cati Boulanger mentor, I redesigned the computer and turned a small space above the keyboard into a digital workspace.
By combining a transparent screen and depth cameras for finger detection and face, you can now lift your hands on the keyboard, reach the inside of this 3D space and grab the pixels with bare hands.
Because our windows and files have a position in the real space, select them is as easy as catching a book on your shelf.
Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines, the words via the virtual keyboard under each floating window.
Architects can stretch or run the models directly with their hands.
Thus, with these examples, we penetrate into the digital world.
But why not reverse the roles, and bring the numerical elements up to us?
I'm sure many of you have experienced buying and returning articles online.
But now, we must not worry anymore.
I brought here an online fitting cabin actually increased.
This is a view that you receive from a display device mounted on the head or transparent thanks to a system that includes the geometry of your body.
Pushing this idea further, I started to tell me: instead of just seeing these pixels in our space, how can we make them concrete so that we can touch them and feel them?
What would such a future look like?
At MIT Media Lab, with my Hiroshi Ishii advisor and my Rehmi Post collaborator, we materialized a pixel.
Here, this spherical magnet acts as a 3D pixel in our space, which means that computers like people can move this object anywhere in this small 3D space.
We have whoever has managed to cancel the severity and control the movement by combining magnetic levitation, mechanical actuation and remote sensing technologies.
By numerically programming the object, we release it from all time and space constraints, which means that now, human movements can be recorded, reproduced and kept indefinitely in the physical world.
So a choreography can be taught physically remotely and the famous Michael Jordan shot can be replicated again and again as a physical reality.
Students can use it as a tool to learn more about complex concepts such as the movement of planets, the laws of physics, and unlike computer screens or textbooks, it's a real experience. Tangible that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
What is much more exciting than just giving shape to what is already in the computer is to start to imagine how the world of programming will change our daily physical activity.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something, but will start acting directly on us as a component of our physical environment without disconnecting us from the world.
Today, we started by talking about limits, but if we delete this limit, the only one we have left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become gymnast for 2 years, in the province of Hunan in China in the 1970s.
When I was in the first year, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid.
But Mom Tiger said, "No. »
My parents wanted me to become engineer like them.
Having survived the cultural revolution, they believed hard as iron that there was only one true way to be happy: a stable and well paid job.
I like this work or not did not matter.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
That's me who plays on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start training from an early age to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything to be accepted at the opera school.
I even wrote to the school director and the facilitator of a radio show.
But no adult liked this idea.
No adult believed I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but it was children, just as powerless as me.
So at fifteen, I understood that I was too old to be trained.
My dream would never come true.
I was afraid that for the rest of my life, a bland happiness would be what I could hope for better.
But it's so unfair.
I was determined to find another vocation.
Nobody to teach me? Perfect.
I turned to the books.
I satisfied my thirst for parental advice by reading this book written by a family of writers and musicians. ["Correspondence in the Faux Lei family] I found myself a model of independent woman while the Confucian tradition demanded obedience. ["Jane Eyre"] and with this book, I learned to be effective. ["Thirteen to the dozen"] and after reading this book, I wanted to study abroad.
["Complete Works of Sanmao"] ["Lessons of History" Not Nan Huaijin] I arrived in the United States in 1995, and in your opinion, what books did I read when you arrived?
Books forbidden in China, of course.
 Chinese land talks about rural life in China.
Not really the ideal for propaganda. OK.
The Bible is interesting but strange.
It's not our topic today.
But the fifth commandment was a revelation: "You will honor your father and your mother. »
"Honoring", I told myself, "it's so different, and better than obey. »
It has become my springboard to get out of this Confucian guilt and to rebuild my relationship with my parents.
In contact with this new culture, I also used to play compared.
It is a great source of lessons.
For example, I found this strange card at first because it is this map that Chinese students are studying.
He had never come to my mind that China may not have been in the center of the world.
A card is only the perspective of someone.
Comparative reading has nothing new.
It is a prevalent practice in academic circles.
There are even areas of research dedicated to comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and put in opposition gives intellectuals a more in-depth understanding of a subject.
So I thought, good, if comparative reading works for the search, why not apply it in everyday life?
So I started reading books by two.
And they can wear people - ["Benjamin Franklin: a Walter Isaacson's American life] John Adams" from David McCullough] - who are involved in the same event, or friends who share the same experiences.
["The autobiography of Katharine Graham"] ["Warren Buffett. Official biography, snowball effect," Alice Schroeder] I also compare similar stories in different genres - [the Bible, version of the king James] ["The Lamb" of Christopher Moore] - or similar stories seen by different cultures, like what Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book. ["The Power of the Myth" of Joseph Campbell] for example, Christ and Buddha both lived three temptations.
For Christ, temptations are economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they are all psychological: the envy, fear and social duty - interesting.
And if you talk about another language, it's fun also reading your favorite books in both languages.
["Zen, Tao and Nirvana", Thomas Merton] ["Tao: The Watercours Way" of Alan Watts] Rather than losing sense, I found that there was so much to win.
For example, it is thanks to the translation that I have realized that "happiness" in Chinese literally translates into "fast joy". Hum!
 Bride in Chinese literally translates into "new mother". Oh oh !
The books were a kind of magic door to get in touch with the people of the past and the present.
I know I'll never feel herself again and helpless.
Having seen my broken dream is really not big thing compared to the sufferings that many others have endured.
I came to believe that becoming reality is not the only reason for being a dream.
His most important purpose is to bring us where the dreams come from, hence the passion comes, hence happiness comes from.
Even a broken dream can do that for you.
So thanks to the books, I am here today, happy, living again with a goal and a clarity of mind, most of the time.
That books are always with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was eight, a new girl joined the class, and she was very impressive, as are always the new girls.
She had a thick hair very brilliant, a cute little kit, she was uncomfortable on capitals, and super strong dictated.
I broke down with jealousy all that year, until I elaborate my sneaky plan.
One day, I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I took myself in the girls' toilets.
When the path has been free, I went out, I introduced myself in the class, and I took note of note on the office of my mistress.
And then I did it.
I tiled the notes of my rival, just a little, only downgraded some of these A.
All of these A.
And I was preparing to put the notebook back in his drawer, when, wait a little, some others from my comrades also had terribly good notes.
So, taking frenzy, I corrected the notes of everyone, without any imagination.
I gave everyone a row of D. and I gave up a row of A. Since I was there, you see, as much enjoy.
I am still puzzled today in front of my behavior.
I do not understand where the idea came from.
I do not understand why I felt so well by doing so.
I felt very well.
I do not understand why I have never been caught.
I mean, however, it should have been so obvious.
I have never been caught.
But more than anything, I wonder why it bothered me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, so strong in dictation?
Jealousy makes me perplexed!
She is so mysterious, yet so widespread.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
We know that primates suffer from it. The blue merles are very inclined.
We know that jealousy is the leading cause of marital murders in the United States.
And yet, none of the studies I read did not know how to decipher the feeling of loneliness it entails, its duration, or the dark joy that accompanies it.
For this, we must turn to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in all possible configurations.
In fact, I do not think it's exaggerated to say that without jealousy, we would not even have literature?
Without the unfaithful Helen, no odyssey.
Without king jealous, no "thousand and one nights".
No Shakespeare.
Farewell The Lycée Reading List, because we lose "the noise and fury", we lose "Gatsby the magnificent", "the sun rises too," Madame Bovary "loses" Anna Karenine ".
No jealousy, not Proust. Of course, I know it's good to say that Proust holds the answer to everything. But in the case of jealousy, it's a little true.
This year is the centenary of his masterpiece, "looking for lost time", which is the most complete study on sexual jealousy and the competitive spirit, my register, that the We can hope to have.
When thinking about Proust, we think of sentimental stuff, right?
We think of the little boy who tries to fall asleep.
We think of a Madeleine soaked in a lavender tea.
We forget how severe his vision was.
We forget how ruthless is.
I mean, they are books that Virginia Woolf said they were tough like Catgut.
I do not know what Catgut is, but I guess it's formidable.
Why are they so good together, novel and jealousy, jealousy and proust?
Is it for the obvious reason that jealousy, which boils down to the subject, desire, obstacle, is a narrative foundation so solid?
I do not know. I think it's a limited explanation, if we think about what happens when you are jealous.
When one is jealous, we tell stories.
We tell stories about the lives of others, and these stories hurt us, because they are designed to hurt us.
As a storyteller and public at the same time, we know exactly what details integrate to return the knife in the wound, right?
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and it is something that Proust had understood.
In the first volume, "On the side of Swann", in the first volumes, Swann, one of the main characters, thinks very tenderly at his mistress, and his qualities in bed, and suddenly, in a few sentences - - And these are Proustian sentences, then they are long as rivers - but in a few sentences, he suddenly resumes, and he realizes, "waiting, all that I love at this woman, anyone from Another would like it too.
All she does who gives me pleasure, could give pleasure to anyone else, if it's right now. »
And here is the story he begins to tell, and from there, Proust writes that every new charm that Swann finds to his mistress, he adds it to his "collection of instruments in his private torture room" .
We must admit that Swann and Proust were notoriously jealous.
You know. Proust's little friends had to leave the country if they wanted to break with him.
But without being jealous at this point, we can admit that the task is tough, right?
Jealousy is exhausting.
It's a demanding emotion. It must be nourished.
What do you like jealousy?
Jealousy loves information.
Jealousy loves the details.
Jealousy loves thickened hair very brilliant, cute little kits.
Jealousy loves photos.
This explains the success of Instagram.
Proust makes the link between scholarly language and jealousy.
When Swann is in the pangs of jealousy, and that suddenly he listens to the doors, and that he surrenders the servants of his mistress, he justifies these behaviors.
He says, "Listen, I know you think it's disgusting, but it's not different from the translation of an old text, or the observation of a monument. »
He says, "These are scientific investigations, with a real intellectual value. »
Proust tries to show us that jealousy seems unforgivable, and gives the absurd air, but that it is, fundamentally, a quest for knowing, a quest for truth, of truth that hurts, and in fact, with respect to Proust, the more the truth hurts, the better.
Grief, humiliation, loss: It was, for Proust, the paths of wisdom.
He says, "A woman we want, who makes us suffer, arouses in us a range of feelings much deeper and vital than a man of genius that interests us. »
Does he advise us to find cruel women?
No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals to ourselves.
Is there another emotion that breaks our armor as particularly?
Is there another emotion that reveals our own aggression, our frightful ambition, and our rights?
Is there another emotion that learn us to observe with such a strange intensity?
Freud will write on this subject later.
One day, Freud received the visit of a very anxious young man who was devoured by the idea that his wife deceitted him.
And Freud said, there is something weird in this guy, because he does not look at what his wife does.
Because it is innocent; Everybody knows it.
The poor woman is suspected without reason.
But he notices what his wife does without taking care, involuntary behaviors.
Does she smile too much here, or is it close to a man inadvertently?
Freud says that man becomes the guardian of the unconscious of his wife.
The novel excels in this area.
The novel excels to describe how jealousy teaches us to look with intensity, but without accuracy.
In fact, the more violently we are jealous, the more we fantasize.
That's why I believe, jealousy does not only push us to commit violent acts, or illegal acts.
Jealousy invites us to adopt frantically inventive behaviors.
I think of myself at the age of eight, I admit, but I also think of this story that I heard about info.
A 52-year-old Michigan resident was taken to create a fake Facebook account with which she even sent, for a year, abominable messages, horrible.
For one year. A year.
She was trying to accuse the new girlfriend of her ex, and I must say that when I heard that, I could only experience admiration.
Because, I mean, let's be serious.
What immense inventiveness, even poorly placed, right?
It's like being in a novel.
It's like being in a novel by Patricia Highsmith.
I have a special preference for Highsmith.
It is a woman of American letters so shiny and strange.
She is the author of "The Unknown North Express". and "Mr. Ripley", books that speak only of jealousy, the way she blurs our spirits, and how, once under his influence, in this realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and this which could be can be pierced in an instant.
Take Tom Ripley, his most famous character.
Tom Ripley starts with you, or desire what you have, then he takes your place and attribute what was yours, you end up between four boards, he answers your name, he wears your ring, he empties your account in bank.
It's a way of doing things.
But what can we do, we? We can not follow the path of Tom Ripley.
I can not give d of the world, even if I really want some days.
And it's a shame, because we live a time of lust.
We live an era of jealousy.
I mean, we are all good practitioners from social networks, where jealousy is commonplace is not it?
Does novels tell us about this problem? I'm wondering.
So let's do what all the characters do when they wonder, when they are facing a mystery.
Let's go to Baker Street number 221 B, and ask Sherlock Holmes.
When we think of Holmes, we think of his Nemesis, Professor Moriarty, yes, this criminal genius.
But I have always preferred inspector Lestrade, Scotland Yard's boss, with his face face, which has terribly need Holmes, need the genius of Holmes, but whoever wants him.
As I understand that!
Lestrade needs his help, he wants him, and only pulls his bitterness throughout novels.
But as they collaborate, something begins to change, and finally, in "the six napoleons", when Holmes arrives and dazzles everyone with his solution, Lestrade turns to him, and said to him, "We are not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes,
We are very proud of you. »
And he adds that there would not be a man in Scotland Yard who would not be happy to shake the hand of Sherlock Holmes.
This is one of the few times we see Holmes be touched, in novels, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
It looks like jealousy is considered a problem of geometry, not like an emotion.
You see, at a time Holmes is the opposite of Lestrade.
And the moment after, they are on the same edge.
Suddenly, Lestrade lets himself go to admire this man who displeased him.
Would it be as simple as that?
And if jealousy was really only a question of geometry, a question of place where one allows us to stand in our relationship to the other?
Well, maybe then we would not have trouble taking the excellence of others?
One could take model.
But I like to have an emergency solution.
So, while waiting for this, let us remember that we can find a consolation in fiction.
Only fiction demystifies jealousy.
Only fiction dump, invites it to our table.
And look at those she brings together: the nice Lestrade, the terrifying Tom Ripley, that crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years in camping with my father in the Adirondacks Massif, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York.
It was a nice day.
The forest was sparkling.
The sun was shining the leaves like stained glass and if it was the way we followed, we could have almost claimed to be the first human beings to walk on this earth.
We arrived at the campsite.
It was a shed on a cliff overlooking a beautiful limpid lake, when I discovered a horror.
Behind the appetized, there was a bunch of junk, perhaps 4 m², with potato trolons, aluminum paper balls, and a broken basketball.
I was amazed, I was very angry and deeply perplexed.
The campers who were too lazy to take away what they had brought who thought they would clean up after them?
This question remained, a little simplified.
Who cleans after us?
Can we go back in all directions, where we place the 'we', who cleans after us in Istanbul?
Who cleans after us in Rio or Paris or London?
Here in New York, the sanitary service cleans itself after us, up to 11,000 tons of garbage and 2000 tons of recyclable material every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who is responsible for the task.
What is it to wear the uniform and wear this burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I rolled in the trucks and walked through the roads, I interview people in offices and institutions all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I stayed a strangers.
I had to go further.
So I took the job as a blister.
I was not just in the trucks. I drove them.
I used the mechanical brushes and I snowed.
It has been a great privilege and an incredible education.
Everyone raises the question of smell.
She is here, but it's not as common as you think, and the days when it feels really bad, you get used to it fast enough.
It takes a long time to get used to the weight.
I have experienced people who have worked for years whose bodies were just beginning to adapt to the weight of wearing tons of waste every week.
Then there is the danger.
According to the US Labor Statistics Agency, the work of garbager is one of the 10 more dangerous occupations of the country, and I learned why.
You are in traffic all day, and it goes at full speed around all sides around you.
They just want to go beyond, so often motorists do not pay attention.
It's really bad for the worker.
And then the garbage themselves are full of dangers that often emerge from the truck and make terribly bad.
I also understood the relentlessness of garbage.
When you come down from the sidewalk and see a city from the back of a truck, you understand that garbage is like a strength of nature in its own right.
They never stop.
They are also like a form of breathing or traffic.
They must always be moving.
And then, there is stigma.
You put the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is angry at you for any reason, like having blocked the traffic with your truck, or because you take a break too close to home, Or drink in coffee in their bar, and they come to show you their contempt and tell you that they do not want you near them.
I find the stigma particularly ironic, because I believe that the garbagers are the most important labor force in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
These are the first public health guards.
If they do not end the garbage effectively every day, they begin to overflow with their garbage cans, and the dangers that follow themselves threatening us really.
The diseases we have under control for decades and centuries reappear again and start harming.
The economy needs them.
If we can not throw the old things, we will not have room for the news, thus, the engines of the economy are starting to get carried away when the consumption is compromised.
I do not defend capitalism, I just emphasize their relationship.
And then there is what I call our average daily speed needed.
By there, I mean, how fast we are used to moving in contemporary times.
Usually we do not care to repair, clean, carry our cup of coffee, our cabas, our bottle of water.
We use them, we whisk them, we forget them, because we know that there are people who work on the other side that will take everything.
So I want to propose two ways to think about sanitation today that can contribute to mitigating the stigma and bring them back into this conversation on how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is a little liturgical.
They are in the streets every day, rhythmically.
They wear a uniform in many cities.
You know when you wait to see them.
And their work allows us to do our job.
They are almost a comfort shape.
The flow they maintain protects us from ourselves, our grime, our old clothes, and this flow must be kept continuously whatever happens.
The next day on September 11 in 2001, I heard the roar of a trash truck in the street, I caught my baby, I went down and there was a man who was collecting paper collection to recycle as he did every Wednesday.
I tried to thank him for his work that day in particular, but I started crying.
He looked at me, he just nodded and he said, "Everything will be fine.
Everything will be alright. »
It's a bit later that I started my research on cleaning, and I met this man again.
His name is Paulie, we worked together several times, and we became good friends.
I want to believe that Paulie was right.
Everything will be alright.
But in the effort to reorganize the way we exist as a species on this planet, we need to take into account all costs, including the very real cost of labor.
And we would do well to reach out to people who do this work and take advice of experts on how we conceive, how we create systems around sustainability that may take us from the collection on sidewalks, which is a remarkable success of the last 40 years, across the United States and other countries in the world, to elevate us to a broader horizon where we consider other forms of waste, from industrial sources and construction, which could be diminished
Municipal waste, what we think when we talk about garbage, 3% account for 3% of the country's waste stream.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So, in the course of your days, in the course of your lives, the next time you see someone whose work is to clean after you, take the time to show you acknowledging.
Take the time to say thank you.
Hello, Tedwomen, how are you?
It's not yet that.
Hello, Tedwomen, how are you?
My name is Mayoon Zayid, and I'm not drunk, but the doctor that gave me birth was.
He opened my mother six times, in six different locations, which resulted in a physite in the operation.
Result: I have cerebral paralysis, which means that I tremble all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Mohammed Ali.
Cerebral palsy is not genetic.
It's not a congenital anomaly. You can not catch it.
Nobody threw out on the uterus of my mother, and I did not have that because my parents were first degree cousins, even if they are.
It happens only by an accident, like the one who happened to me the day of my birth.
I prefer to warn you, I'm not an example, and I do not want anyone in this room complains, because it surely had a moment in your life, where you dreamed of being disabled.
Imagine.
It's Christmas Eve, you are at the mall, you turn in circles to find a parking space, and what do you see?
Sixteen places for disabled, empty.
And you say, "My God, why am I not nothing but a little invalid? »
And then, I have to tell you, I have tons of problems, paralysis is only one of 99 others.
If there were Olympic oppression games, I would win the gold medal.
I am Palestinian, Muslim, I am a woman, I am invalid, and I live in New Jersey.
It should help you feel better about your skin.
I grew up in Cliffside Park, in New Jersey.
I have always loved the fact that my neighborhood and my affection share the same initials.
I also like the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house until New York, I could.
Many people who have cerebral palsy can not walk, but my parents did not accept that they are "I can not".
The mantra of my father was, "You can do it, yes, you can be able. »
So, if my three senior sisters passed the mop, I passed the mop.
If my three senior sisters went to the public school, my parents were complaining against the school system to get that I'm also there, and if we did not all have a, we were all the favorites of Savate mother.
My father taught me to walk when I was 5 years old by placing my heels on his feet and walking, just.
Another tactic he used was to shake a dollar ticket in front of me, and I had to catch him.
The stripper in me was very strong, and to ... yes. At my entering kindergarten, I already walked like a champion that took a blow too much.
When I was small, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all part of my family.
Now, there are twenty Arabs in town, and they are still all of my family.
I believe that no one has even realized that we were not Italian.
It was before September 11th, and before politicians do not suggest that it was good to have as a campaign slogan "I hate Muslims."
My faith posed no problem for people with whom I grew up.
On the other hand, they were very afraid that I die of hunger during Ramadan.
I explained to them that I had enough fat to live on it for three whole months, and so, fast from sunrise to sunset, it was cake.
I made taps in Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway. It's crazy.
My parents could not pay for rehabilitation, so they sent me to a dance school.
I learned to dance up high heels, which means that I can walk in high heels.
And I'm coming from New Jersey, where much importance is given to elegance, so if my friends wore high heels, too.
And while my friends were going to spend their holidays on the coast of New Jersey, not me.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we do not return every summer in Palestine, we would end like Madonna.
My father often spent the big holidays trying to heal me, so I drank deer milk, I was asked suction cups on the back, I was plunged into the dead sea, and I remember that the Water burned my eyes, and I thought, "It works! That works ! »
But we found a miracle cure: yoga.
I must tell you, it's very boring, but before doing yoga, I was a stand-up comic that was not standing.
Now, I can do the pear tree.
My parents inculcate me the idea that I could succeed, that no dream was out of my reach, and my dream was to play in the series "Central Hospital".
I went to the FAC thanks to positive discrimination and I had a good scholarship for the ASU, Arizona State University, because I fulfilled each of the quotas.
I was the mascot of the theater section.
Everyone loved me.
I did the homework of the children not very intelligent, I had to all my exams, and from them to all their exams.
Whenever I played a scene of "glass menagerie" my teachers cryed.
But I never got a role.
Finally, during my last year, the ASU decided to set up a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson".
It's a piece on a girl with cerebral palsy.
I am a girl who has cerebral palsy.
I started screaming on all the roofs, "I will finally have a role!
I have a cerebral paralysis!
Finally free ! Finally free !
Thank God Almighty, I am finally free! »
I did not have the role.
Sherry Brown had the role.
I ran to see the director of the theater section by sobbing madly, as if we had just killed my cat, I asked her why, and she told me that it was because they thought I could not Make the cascades.
I said, "Excuse me, but if I can not do the waterfalls, the character either. »
I was literally born for this role, and they gave it, they gave it to a non-paralyzed actress.
The university only imagined life.
Hollywood has sordid habit of taking non-disabled players to play nods on the screen.
As soon as I graduated, I returned home, and my first actress service was a figuration in a daily series.
My dream became reality.
I was sure I would have promoted the role of "girlfriend" to that of "best stamped friend" in no time.
Instead, I remained a potiche that could only be recognized by the neck. I quickly realized that the casting directors did not recruit pulpy, ethnic and disabled actresses.
They only recruit the perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr, Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedy.
So I have become comedy.
My first contract was to drive New York's famous humorists to shows in New Jersey, and I will never forget the head of the first humorist I drove when he understood that he was riding on the highway New Jersey with driving a girl with cerebral palsy.
I happened in clubs all over America, and I also played in Arabic in the Middle East, not censored and not veiled.
Some people say that I am the first booster of the Arab world stand-up.
I never liked to say first ', but I know they had never heard this dirty small rumor according to which women are not funny, and they find us twist.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and another father, Dean Obeidallah and myself, created the New York Arab-American Laughter Festival, which is his tenth year now.
Our goal was to change the negative image of American Arabs in the media, and also recall the casting managers that South Asian and Arabic are not synonyms.
Integrating Arabs has been much easier than meeting the challenge of disabled stigmatization.
My big breakthrough took place in 2010.
I was offered to be a guest in the "Countdown With Keith Olbermann" cable information issue.
I made my entry as if I went to the end-of-year ball, they dragged me in a studio, and they sat on a swivel wheel chair.
I looked at the tray barrier and I told him, "excuse me, could I have another chair? »
She looked at me and started, "Five, four, three, two ..."
And we were live, you see?
So I had to take me to the presenter's office so you do not ride off the screen during the sequence, and when the interview was finished, I was pale.
I finally had my luck and I had spoiled him, I knew I would never be invited again.
Not only did Mr. Olbermann reinvite me, but he made me a full-time collaborator, and he tacked my chair.
One thing I learned by being on the air, with Keith Olbermann, it is that the human beings on the internet are punctures.
People say that children are cruel, but we had never made fun of me, neither child nor adult.
Suddenly, my handicap has become an ideal target on the web.
I watched the videos online, and I saw comments like: "Why does it tremble? »
"She's expeditious or what? »
And my favorite: "poor terrorist bouffonne.
What does she suffer?
We should really pray for her. »
One of the authors of comments even suggested that I add my handicap to my business card: author, humorist, paralyzed.
Disability is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can not play Beyoncé, so Beyoncé can not play someone in wheelchair.
The disabled are the biggest ... Yes, you can applaud. Go for it !
People with handicaps are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in the show.
The doctors said that I would never walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, if I had grown up with social networks, I do not think I'll be there.
I hope everyone will be able to create a more positive image of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if we saw more positive images, it would encourage less hatred on the internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it still takes a village to teach good to our children.
My tortuous trip took me to very spectacular places.
I trampled the red carpet alongside the series of Series Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus.
I had a role in a movie with Adam Sandler and I worked with my idol, the incredible Dave Matthews.
I went on tour in the world as a head of poster of the festival "The Arabs let go".
I was delegated to represent the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 National Democrat Convention.
And I founded "the children of Mayoon" a work of charity that hopes to give children Palestinian refugees a tiny part of the chance that my parents gave me.
But the moment that counts the most was when I - before now - but the moment that counts the most for me, it's when I played for the man flying like a butterfly and stung like a Bee, who has Parkinson and tremble, just like me, Mohamed Ali.
It's the only one and only my father saw me play on stage, and I dedicate this conference to his memory.
My name is Mayoon Zayid, and if I can power, then you can power.
In the past, we have solved big problems.
On July 21, 1969 Buzz Aldrin came out of Apollo 11 lunar module and dropped into the sea of ​​tranquility.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the gray surface of the moon, was the culmination of a collective, convulsive effort.
The Apollo program allowed the most important mobilization in the period of peace, the history of the United States.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about $ 180 billion, or 4% of the federal budget.
Apollo employed about 400,000 people and required the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, whose crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program has ended 24 men stole from the moon.
Twelve walked on his surface, including Aldrin, who, following Armstrong's death last year, became the oldest of them.
So, why were they went there?
They did not bring great thing to their return: 380 kg of old stones, and something that these 24 people pointed out later - a new sense of smallness and the fragility of our common house.
Why are they went there? The cynical answer is that they went there because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his country had better rockets.
But the words Kennedy pronounced at Rice University in 1962 give a better idea.
Jason Pontin: For our contemporary historians, Apollo was not just a western victory on the east during the cold war.
At the time, the strongest emotion was the wonder generated by the transcendent powers of technology.
They went there because it was a great thing to do.
The landing on the moon has occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs.
The first half of the 20th century produced: the mounting chain and the plane, the penicillin and a tuberculosis vaccine.
In the middle of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
The technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler, in 1970, called: "acceleration power."
During most of the human history, we could not go faster than a horse, or a sailing boat, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to a speed of 40,000 km / h.
Since 1970, no human being has returned to the moon.
Nobody traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and then this carefree optimism on the powers of technology has evaporated like the great problems that we had imagined that could be solved by technology. As going on Mars, creating clean energy, cure cancer, or nourishing the whole world, we seem today irreducibly complex.
I remember looking at Apollo's take-off.
I was five years old, and my mother told me not to fix the exhaust system of one of the saturn V rockets.
I was vaguely aware that it was to be the last of the lunar missions, but I was absolutely sure that I would attend the colonies of Mars, during my life.
So, "Something has happened to our ability to solve big problems through technology" has become a known refrain.
We hear that all the time.
It has been heard over the last two days here in TED.
It seems that technologists have diverted our attention to insignificant gadgets, with which they enriched themselves. Like iPhones, different applications and social networks, or algorithms that have increased the speed of automated exchange systems.
There is nothing wrong in most of these things.
They expanded and enriched our lives.
But they do not resolve the big problems of humanity.
What happened then?
There is a parish explanation in Silicon Valley, who admits that she has funded less ambitious companies she did during the years she funded Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
Silicon Valley says that markets are to blame, especially aid that investors offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says investors have abandoned the financing of processing ideas for additional funding issues or even false problems.
But I do not think this explanation is good enough.
She explains especially what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even when the risker capital was in the most favorable state, they preferred small investments, these small investments that offer them profitability at 10 years.
Capital riskers have always struggled to invest with profit in technologies such as energy that requires huge capital and whose development is long and endless, and have never, never funded the development of technologies to solve big problems that do not have any immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons for our inability to solve big problems are more complicated and deeper.
Sometimes we chose not to solve these big problems.
We could go on Mars if we wanted it.
NASA even has a draft plan.
But going on Mars would be the consequence of a political decision following a popular manifestation, and that will never happen.
We will not go on Mars, because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on earth.
Sometimes we can not solve big problems because our political systems fail.
Today, less than 2% of energy consumption in the world comes from peak renewable sources, such as solar, wind and biofuels. Less than 2%, and reason is purely economical.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind energies, and oil is cheaper than biofuels.
We want alternative sources of energy at competitive prices. There are none.
Technologists, business leaders and economists are all fundamentally agreed that national policies and international treaties could stimulate the development of alternative energies: essentially, a significant increase in research and development on energy , and a kind of price on carbon.
But in the current political climate, there is no hope of seeing an American energy policy or international treaties that embody this consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological actually prove to be.
It has long been believed that famines were caused by failures in food supply.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crises that have a catastrophic incidence on food distribution.
Technology can improve things such as crop yield or food storage and transport systems, but there will be famines as there are bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes evade the solutions because we do not really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the Cancer War in 1971, but we quickly discovered that there were many types of cancer, most of them being diabolically resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 Years that viable and effective therapies have begun to see the light of day.
Difficult problems are difficult.
It is wrong to think that we can not solve big problems through technology.
It can be done, but the following four elements must all be together: the political leaders and the people must deal with solving a problem; Institutions must take charge of its solution; It really needs to be a technological problem; And we must understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become a kind of metaphor to illustrate the ability of technology to solve big problems, satisfy these criteria.
But it is a non-reproducible model in the future.
We are no longer in 1961.
There is no competition that galvanizes us as during the cold war, and there is no politician like John Kennedy who can make heroic the difficulty and danger, and no futuristic popular mythology such as the exploration of the system solar.
And more than anything, going on the moon has finally proven easy.
It only took three days.
And it probably did not even solve many problems.
We remain alone in the face of the problems of our time, and the solutions will be more difficult to find in the future.
God knows that we do not lack challenges!
Thank you so much.
I would like to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine that you are standing in front of your front door.
I would like you to notice the color of the door, the material in which it is made.
Now visualize a group of overweight nudists on bicycles.
They run in a nudist bike race, and they go straight on your front door.
I ask you to visualize that.
They are really pedaling, they sweat, they bounce out not bad here and there.
And they go straight on the front door of your home.
Bicycles fly everywhere, the wheels roll next to you, the rays land at odd locations.
Skide your door in the entrance, the hall, regardless of the room that is on the other side, and enjoy the quality of the light.
The light shines on macaron.
Macaron salutes you from the top of a champagne horse.
It's a horse that speaks.
You can almost feel the blue fur you tickle your nose.
You can feel cookie with oatmeal grapes and flakes that it is about to swallow.
You exceed it. You enter your living room.
In your living room, with your high speed imagination, view Britney Spears.
She is almost undressed, she dances on your coffee table, and she sings "Hit Me Baby One More Time".
Then follow me in your kitchen.
In your kitchen, the ground has been paved with a yellow brick road. And coming out of your oven, come to you Dorothy, the iron-white man, the soil and the lion of the "Oz magician" hand in hand hopping right towards you.
Ok. Open your eyes.
I'm going to talk about a very strange competition that stands every spring in New York City.
It's called the United States Memory Championship.
And I went to cover this competition a few years ago as a scientific journalist waiting for me, I imagine, to what it is like the World Cup of the scientists.
It was a bunch of guys and some women, greatly different as well as and hygiene.
They memorized hundreds of random numbers, looking at once.
They memorized the first names of dozens of dozens of foreigners.
They memorized entire poems in just a few minutes.
They were competing to see who could memorize the mixed order as soon as possible with a play card game.
I told myself, this is amazing.
These people must be anomalies of nature.
And I started talking to a few participants.
Here is a guy called Ed Cook who had come from England where he was one of the best trained memories.
And I told him, "Ed, when did you realize that you were a scholar? »
And Ed replied, "I'm not a scholar.
In fact, I have a memory average.
All those who compete in this competition will tell you that they have a memory average.
We all trained to accomplish these miraculous memory exploits using ancient techniques, invented techniques 2500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize these speeches, used by the intellectuals of the Middle Ages. memorize whole books. »
And I thought, "Wow, how is it that I have never heard of that before? »
And we stood outside the hall of competition and Ed, which is a wonderful, brilliant, but somehow eccentric, "Josh, you are an American journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears? »
" What ? No. Why ? »
"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a pack of playing cards mixed on American national television.
It will prove to the world that anyone can do it. »
I answered, "I'm not Britney Spears, but you can learn me to me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, right? »
And it was the beginning of a very strange trip for me.
I ended up spending most of the following year not only training my memory, but also to investigate, trying to understand how it walks, why sometimes it does not work and why sometimes it may be going to walk.
I met a lot of very interesting people.
Here is a guy called E.P.
It is an amnesic that most likely, the worst memory of the world.
His memory was so bad that he did not even remember having a memory problem, which is fascinating.
It was this incredibly tragic person but also a window towards the idea that our memories make us what we are.
At the other end of the spectrum: I met this guy.
It's Kim Peek.
It was the reference for the Character of Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man".
We spent an afternoon together in the public bookstore of Salt Lake City, to memorize directories, which was brilliant.
I came back and read a package of treaties on the memory, written treaties more than 2000 in Latin, in antiquity and later in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of things very interesting.
One of the very interesting things I learned is that at one time, this idea of ​​having a result, disciplined, cultivated was not so foreign that it seems to us today.
At one time, people invest in their memory, fully filling their heads.
During these last millennia we invented a series of technologies, the parchment alphabet to the manuscripts, the typographic press, photography, computer, smartphones - which have gradually made more and easier The outsourcing of our memories, simply the outsourcing of this essential human ability.
These technologies have made our modern world possible but they have also changed us.
They changed us culturally, and I would grow that they changed us cognitively.
Having little need to memorize it sometimes seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on earth where you always find people passionate about this idea of ​​a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory is at this competition of memory quite singular.
It is not so singular there are similar competitions anywhere in the world.
And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University College London gathered some memory champions in a laboratory.
They wanted to know: do these guys have brains that have something structurally or anatomically different from ours?
The answer is no.
Are they smarter than the rest of us?
They made them pass a series of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.
There was, however, a very interesting thing and showing differences between the brain of memory champions and those of the subjects-controls to which they compared them.
By putting them in an MRI machine, which scanned their brain while they memorized numbers, first names and snowflake images, they discovered that the memory champions used different parts of their brain compared to others.
They used, or seemed to use, part of the brain that is involved in spatial memory and orientation.
Why ? And is there anything the rest of us can draw from us?
The competition memorization sport is trained by a kind of iron arm where every year, someone invents a new way to memorize more quickly, and the rest must make up for lost time.
Here is my friend Ben Pridmore, three times world memory champion.
On his desk in front of him there are 36 playing card packages mixed as it is about to try to memorize in one hour, using a technique he has invented and that he alone mastery.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4140 binary digits at random in half an hour.
Yeah.
And if there are a lot of ways to memorize tips in these competitions, all the techniques that are used, will have a single concept that psychologists call elaborate encoding.
And this is well illustrated by the superb paradox known as the baker's paradox / baker who comes down to this: if I say to two people to remember the same word, if I tell you, "Remember there is a Monsieur called Boulanger. »
That's his name.
And if I tell you "Remember there is a gentleman who is baker. »
And if I come back to you later, and I say, "Do you remember the word I told you earlier?
Do you remember what it was? »
The person to whom his name was baker is less able to remember the same word as the person to whom he said he was baker
Same word, different way to remember; It's weird.
What is happening ?
Well the name of baker does not tell you personally.
It is not attached to any souvenir floating in your brain.
But the common name baker, we all know bakers.
Bakers have funny white hats.
Bakers have flour on the hands.
Bakers feel good when they come home.
And maybe we know one.
And when we hear the word for the first time, we begin to put associative hooks that later facilitates the repechage.
All the art of what is happening in these memory competitions and the art of remembering things everyday is to find ways to transform the lowercase b baker's b baker's b baker - to take a Information that lacks context, importance, meaning and transform it in a certain way into something significant in the light of all the other things you have in mind.
One of the most elaborate techniques for doing it from 2500 years in ancient Greece
This was known as the palace of memory.
The story behind his creation tells: There was a poet called Simonide who attended a banquet.
He was actually engaged to entertain, because at that time if you wanted to organize a thunder party, you do not bother a DJ, you hired a poet.
So he gets up, says his memory poem, comes out of the room, and when he does, the banquet hall collapses, killing everyone inside.
It did not just kill everyone, the bodies are crushed beyond any possible recognition.
Nobody can say who was inside, no one can say where they were sitting.
The bodies can not be buried properly.
It's a double tragedy.
Simonide, standing outdoors, the only survivor among debris, closes his eyes and awareness, what is in the eye of his mind, he can see where each of the banquet guests were sitting.
And he takes the family members by the hand and guides each of them to their loved ones in the middle of the debris.
What Simonide understood at this time is something I think we know intuitively that is that, as bad as we are to remember the names and numbers of telephone and instructions word for our colleagues, We really have an exceptional visual and spatial memory.
If I asked you to tell the first 10 words of the story I just told you about Simonide, there is a strong chance that it is difficult for you.
But I bet if I ask you to remind you who is sitting on a champagne horse who speaks in your entrance, you would be able to see that.
The idea behind the palace of the memory is to create this imaginary building in your mind and fill it with images of things you want to remember - the more crazy, curious, bizarre, funny, torrid, stinky The more likely she is to be unforgettable.
These are advice that goes back more than 2000 years at the time of the first Latin treaties on memory.
So, how does it work?
Let's say you've been invited on the main stage of TED to keep a speech and want to make it memory, and you want to do it the way Cicero would have done it if it had been invited to Tedxrome there At 2000 years.
What you can do is project the image of yourself at the front door of your home.
And it would have come to mind a kind of image absolutely crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable for you to remember that the first thing you want to talk about is this completely bizarre contest.
You will then go inside your house, and you would see the image of Macaron on Mister Ed's back.
And it would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then, you would see the image of Britney Spears to remind you of this fun anecdote you want to tell.
And you go to your kitchen, and the fourth thing you are talking about is this strange trip that you have done in one year, and you have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the Roman speakers memorized their speeches - no word a word, which is doomed to failure, but subject after subject.
In fact, the term "topic sentence" [introductory phrase] that comes from the Greek word "Topos", which means "place".
is a vestige that remains of the time when people thought of the oratory and rhetoric in spatial terms.
The term "first" it's like the first place of your memory palace.
I thought it was just fascinating, and I really started.
And I went to others of these memory competitions.
And I had this idea that I could write something more about this sub-culture of memoirs competition.
But there was a problem.
The problem was a memory contest is a pathologically boring event.
Really, it's like a lot of sitting people who spend an admission test.
I mean, the most dramatic moment is when someone begins to massage the temples.
And I'm a journalist, I need to write about something.
I know there is this incredible thing that happens in these spirits, but I do not have access.
And I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I had to put myself a bit in their place.
And so I started trying to spend 15 to 20 minutes every morning before sitting to read my New York Times trying to remember something.
Maybe it was a poem.
Maybe it was names in a directory of alumni bought in a flea market.
And I thought it was incredibly fun.
I will never have expected that.
It was fun, because it does not really look at the formation of your memory.
What you do is try to be better and even better to create, dream of these totally ridiculous, hilarious and torrid images and with a little unforgettable luck in your mind.
And I took myself at the game.
It's me wearing my competition memorization training kit.
It is an ignition helmet and safety glasses that have been hidden with the exception of two small holes, because distraction is the largest enemy of the competition memorizer.
I ended up coming back to the same contest as I covered a year earlier.
And I had this idea that I could enter, a kind of participatory journalism experience.
I should have done a nice epilogue to all my research.
The problem is that the experience has been packed.
I won the contest, which was not really supposed to happen.
Now it's nice to be able to memorize the speeches and phone numbers and the lists of the races, but the question is not there.
These are only some tips.
These are tips that work because they are based on basic principles about how our brain works.
And you do not have to build memory palaces or memorize card packets to play for an overview of the operation of your mind.
We are often talking about people with good memory as if it were a kind of innate donation, but that's not the case.
Have a good memory, it learns.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we are deeply committed.
We remember when we are able to take information and experience and understand why it's meaningful, why is it important, why is it colorful, when we are able to transform it so that it is logical to light Of all the other things that float in our minds, when we are able to transform bakers into bakers.
The palace of memory, these memory techniques, are fair shortcuts.
In fact, these are not really shortcuts.
They walk because they make you work.
They force a depth of treatment, a kind of consciousness, that most of us do not work normally.
There is actually no shortcut.
That's how things become memorable.
And I think that if there is one thing I want to leave you, that's what E.P., the amnesic that could not even remember that he had a memory problem, left me, which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we ready to lose our already very short life by losing us in our Blackberry, our iPhone, not paying attention to the human in front of us who speaks to us, being so lazy we are not ready to treat deeply?
I learned from myself that there are incredible unrealized memory capabilities in each of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life you have to be the type of person who remembers to remember.
Thank you.
When I was 27, I gave up a very demanding job of management consultant for even more demanding work: teaching.
I went to teach maths to fifth students in New York public schools.
And like any teacher, I did questionnaires and tests.
I gave homework at home.
When my students made the job, I calculated the notes.
What struck me is that Q.I. was not the only difference between my best pupils and the worst.
Some of those who had the best results did not have a phenomenal Q.I.
Some of my most intelligent students did not succeed very well.
And it made me think.
The things we have to learn in math in fifth, of course, it's hard: fractions, decimals, the surface of a parallelogram.
But these concepts are not impossible to understand, and I was firmly convinced that all my students could learn these notions if they worked quite hard and long enough.
After several years to teach, I have come to the conclusion that what we need, in education, is a better understanding of the students and the learning process from the point of view of motivation, of the psychological point of view.
In education, what we know how best to measure is the intelligence quotient. But if succeed in school and in life depended on much more than the ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left my classroom, and I went to a degree to become a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of very demanding situations, and in every study, my question was: who succeeds in this situation and why?
I went with my research team at the West Point Military Academy.
We tried to predict which cadets would pursue their military training and which would abandon.
We went to the National Spelling Bee [NDT: Spelling Competition in the United States] and we tried to predict what children would go far furthest in the competition.
We have studied beginner teachers who worked in really difficult neighborhoods, and we wondered which teachers would still teach there at the end of the school year, and among those who would best succeed in improving learning outcomes their students.
We have associated ourselves with private companies, and we wondered: Which of these sellers will keep their job?
And who will win the most money?
In all these very different contexts, a feature came out like a significant factor of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It was not appearance, physical health, and it was not Q.I.
It was tenacity.
Toughness is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
Tenacity is to have endurance.
Tenacity is clinging to his future, day after day not just for a week, or a month, but for years, and work really hard for this future to become a reality.
Toughness is to live his life as if she was a marathon, not a sprint.
A few years ago, I started studying tenacity in Chicago's public schools.
I asked thousands of college students to answer toughness questionnaires, and then waited more than a year to see which they were graduated.
The result is that the most stubborn children had much more likely to have their degree, even when I made them match all the variables I could measure, as their family income, their test results. Standard success, and even if they felt safe when they were at school.
So it's not just in West Point or National Spelling Bee that toughness is important. It is also at school, especially for children who are likely to leave along the way.
For me, what shocks me most about tenacity is how little we know, how much science knows little about how it is constructed.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How to make my children be stubborn?
What should children do to teach a strong ethics of work?
How should I do to stay motivated over the duration? »
To be honest, I do not know.
What I know is that having talent does not make you tenacious.
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who do not persevere in their commitments.
In fact, in our data, tenacity is generally unrelated to talent, or even inversely proportional to talent.
So far, the best idea I have heard about how to develop children's tenacity is called "growth mentality"
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Dweck has shown that when children read and learn things about the brain, on how it changes and grows in response to a challenge, they are much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they do not believe Not that failure is a permanent condition.
The growth mentality is therefore an excellent idea to build tenacity.
But we need more.
And I'll finish on these remarks, because that's where we are.
It's the work that awaits us.
We must take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we have to test them.
We need to measure if we have succeeded, and we must be ready to fail, to be wrong, starting again by having learned from our mistakes.
In other words, we must be stubborn to ensure that our children are more tenacious.
Thank you.
My work focuses primarily on the link between the perception of our life in community and the fact that it is part of the environment as architecture is developing from local conditions and traditions.
Today, I will introduce two recent projects that illustrate that.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that the different analyzes from the different perspectives become an essential part of the final architecture.
The first example began with an invitation, designing a multi-storey shopping center in the capital Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.
Here is the type of building we have been shown by way of example, to my team and myself, and that we were supposed to conceive.
The first thing I thought was: I want to run away.
After seeing some of these buildings, because there are many in this city we realized that they shared three essential points.
First of all, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can not afford to buy things.
Second, they need a lot of energy because of the glass facade that creates heat inside, and which induces significant cooling requirements
In a city where it should not happen because there is a very soft climate that varies between 20 and 25 degrees throughout the year.
Finally third, their aspect has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It is unfortunate, in a place that contains such a culture and rich traditions.
Also, during our first visit to Ethiopia, I really captivated by the old district of Merkato, which has an outdoor space where thousands of people will buy things every day at small sellers.
In addition, there is this idea of ​​public space that uses the outside to create activity.
I then thought, that's really that's what I want to conceive, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to realize a multi-storey contemporary building according to these principles.
The other challenge was the site, located in a growing area of ​​the city, where most of the buildings you see in this picture, did not exist at that moment.
In addition it is located between two parallel streets that have no connection on hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, positioning all the entrances of the building.
And it gives on an inclined atrium that creates an outdoor space in the building that self-protects from the sun and rain, thanks to its own shape.
And around this void we introduced this idea of ​​the market with small shops, which change on each floor because of the shape of the vacuum.
I also thought about how to partition the building?
And I really wanted to find a solution that would meet local climatic conditions.
I then started to think of the textile as a concrete shell with perforations that would allow the passage of air, and also light, but in a filtered manner.
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of Ethiopian dresses,
Who have fractal geometric properties, and it helped me shape the whole facade.
We build it with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and light in a controlled manner inside the building.
And this is complemented by these small colorful glasses that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas, it was not easy at the beginning to convince the promoters because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. We did not ask that. »
But then we all understood that this idea of ​​the market would be much more profitable than the idea of ​​a shopping center because basically they had more businesses for sale.
And also because the idea of ​​the facade was much cheaper, not only because of the material, compared to the glass, but also because we no longer need to have air conditioning.
We have therefore created budget savings we used to implement the project.
And the first step was to think how to make the building autonomous in terms of energy in a city or electricity is cut almost every day.
A huge plus has been to place photovoltaic panels on the roof.
And then under these panels we thought the roof as a new public space with places of meetings and bars to create a kind of urban oasis.
And all these roof porches make it possible to collect water that is reused in sanitation inside.
Let's hope it ends here the beginning of the year, we are already on the fifth floor.
The second example is a Master Plan of 2000 apartments and premises in the city of Tunis.
And to realize such a project, the biggest project I have never designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings, traditions and culture.
During this analysis, I paid special attention to the medina a 1000-year-old construction that was formerly partitioned by a wall, and open by twelve different doors, connected by substantially straight lines.
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was expanding the existing streets, creating 12 starting blocks of size and similarities similar to those we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe, with these courses.
In addition to this, we have selected some strategic points and connected by straight lines, to evoke this idea of ​​the doors, which changed the initial configuration.
And the last operation was to see the cell, the basic component of the project, such as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
And for that I wondered, "What would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment? »
North-South, as this creates a thermal difference between the two sides of the house and so a natural ventilation.
So we chose an arrangement that ensures that most apartments are perfectly oriented in this direction.
And here is the result: it's almost a combination of the European bloc and the Arab city.
There are these blocks with classes, then on the ground floor you have all these connections for pedestrians.
This also meets local regulations that require higher density in upper levels and lower density on the ground floor.
And it also consolidates the idea of ​​the doors.
The volume has this form of connection nuanced by three different types of apartments which also allows the ground floor to be exposed to the light in a very dense neighborhood. And there are different premises in courses, such as a gym and a kindergarten and nearby, a series of businesses bringing an activity on the ground floor.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project, almost comes to restore the space occupied by construction.
And that's where all the neighbors can come together, and do activities like a two-kilometer race of good morning, passing from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are located in emerging countries where one can literally see the cities grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of today's and tomorrow modifies communities and local economies at the same speed as buildings grow.
For this reason, I think it's even more important to turn to architecture to find simple but accessible solutions that reinforce the relationship between the community and the environment and aimed at bringing nature and people closer together.
Thank you so much.
I will now talk about trust, and I will start by reminding you of the general opinion of people about trust.
I think there are so many common places, they have become shots of our society.
I think there are three.
The first is an affirmation: there has been a great decline of trust, and we believe very largely.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a task: we should restore confidence.
I think the affirmation, the goal and the task are all thought of under a bad angle.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about an affirmation, a goal and a task that I believe, offers a much better grip on this issue.
First, the affirmation: why do people think that trust has decreased?
And if I really think about it, according to my own experience, I do not know the answer.
I tend to think that it may have decreased for some activities or institutions and may be increased for others.
I do not have an overview.
But, of course, I can look at opinion polls, and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
In fact, when you look at opinion polls over time, there is not really evidence of that.
That is, people who inspired mistrust 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still inspire mistrust.
And the people we had great confidence 20 years ago are still highly trustworthy: judges, nurses.
The rest of us is in the middle, and by the way, the ordinary person, in the street, finds himself almost exactly halfway.
But is it a credible proof?
What opinion polls report, obviously, these are opinions.
What else could they bring back?
So they seek to know the general opinion of people when asked some questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now, if someone tells you, "Do you trust vegetable merchants?
Do you trust the fishmen?
Do you trust primary school teachers? »
You will probably start by asking, "To do what? »
And it would be a completely sensible reaction.
And you could say, when you will answer, "Well, I trust some of them, but not to others. »
It's quite rational.
In short, in our real lives, we give our confidence in a differential way.
It is not presumed that the degree of confidence will be for a certain type of employee, official or person will always be the same.
I can, for example, say that I certainly confidence in a certain primary school teacher that I know to teach to read to his class, but in no case to drive the school bus.
I can, after all, know that it is not good driver.
I can trust my most talkative friends to keep a conversation but not to keep a secret.
It's simple.
So if we see, in our daily life, these examples that show that trust is variable, why does this information forget when we think of trust more abstract?
I think the polls are very bad guides on the degree of trust that actually exists, because they try to make disappear the good judgment that we use by granting our confidence.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
That's not what I'll see.
I would pose more to have more confidence with respect to trust but not with respect to trust.
In fact, I'm trying not to trust what is not honest.
And I think of these people who, for example, placed their economies in the hands of people like the well named Madoff, who fled with them, and I think of them and I say, well, yes, yes. , too much confidence.
More confidence is not an intelligent goal in this world.
Granting and refuse intelligently trust is the real goal.
So once they say, someone says yes, ok, it means that the important, in the first place, it is not confidence but honesty.
It's trying to how much people are trustworthy for specific issues.
And I think this judgment requires that three points examine.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
And if we find that a person is competent in a relevant, reliable and honest subject, we have pretty good reasons to trust him. Because she will be trustworthy.
But if, moreover, it is unreliable, we should not trust him.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I would not trust them to post a letter because they are distracted.
I have friends who are very confident that they can do certain things, but I realize that they overestimate their own skills.
And I am very proud to say that I do not think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
If so, I have not spotted them yet.
But here is what we are looking for: honesty before trust.
Trust is the answer.
Honesty is what we need to evaluate. And, of course, it's difficult.
In recent decades, we have tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, employees, etc., to help us assess their honesty.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They do not work as they should.
I remember talking with a midwife who said, "Well, do you see, the problem is that it's longer to fill the paperwork that put the baby to the world. »
And everywhere in our public, institutional, we find ourselves with the problem that the accountability system, designed to protect honesty and the evidence of honesty actually the opposite.
He distracted people who must perform difficult tasks, such as midwives, their work, demanding they check boxes, as they say.
You can add your own examples here.
So here's for the goal.
The goal, I think, it's more honesty, and things will change if we try to be honest and communicate our honesty to other people, and if we try to evaluate if other people , officials or politicians, are honest.
It is not easy. It's a matter of judgment and reactions, simple answers have no place here.
Now, thirdly, the task.
Say that the task is to restore confidence also brings us back, I think,
It assumes that you and I should restore confidence.
Well, we can do that by ourselves.
We can restore a little honesty.
We can do that, two people together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, is particular because it is granted by other people.
You can not restore what other people give you.
You must give them reasons for them to give you their confidence.
So you must, I believe, be trustworthy.
And that, obviously, it's because you can not deceive everyone, all the time, usually.
But you must also provide concrete proof that you are trustworthy.
How to do ?
Well, every day, everywhere, ordinary people, officials, institutions, do it quite efficiently.
Let me give you a simple example, in the commerce.
At the shop where I buy my socks, it allows me to return them without being asked questions.
They take them back and give me money or give me a pair of socks of the color I wanted.
That's great. I trust them because they do themselves vulnerable to me.
I think there is a big lesson to remember that.
If you show your vulnerability to the other party, it's a very good proof that you are honest and trust in what you say.
So in the end, I think the goal is not very difficult to discern.
These are the relationships in which people are honest and able to judge when and how the other person is trustworthy.
So the moral of all that is that we must think much less to trust, let alone the signs of confidence revealed or not by opinion polls, and much more to be honest and at the way to give people relevant, useful and simple evidence that you are trustworthy.
Thank you.
The best time, when you are dad it's the movies I can watch.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we watched "The Wizard of Oz" together.
This film has completely captivated its imagination for months.
His favorite character was glinda, of course.
It gave him a good excuse to wear a glitter dress and have a magic wand.
But if we look at this movie enough times, we start to realize how unusual it is.
The world in which we live and raise our children is a kind of industrial complex of a magical world for children.
But "The Wizard of Oz" was an exception.
He did not initiate this trend.
It is only 40 years older than this trend really started, with, surprisingly, another film featuring a metal guy and a hairy guy who save a girl by disguising themselves in enemy guards.
Do you see what I'm talking about ?
Yes.
There is a big difference between these two films, some very important differences between "the magician of Oz" and all the movies we look at today.
The first is that there is little violence in "the magician of Oz".
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as well as apple trees.
But I think so "the Wizard of Oz" had to be realized today, the magician would say, "Dorothy, you are the Savior of Oz that the prophecy speaks.
Use your magic shoes to overcome the synthesis armies of the wicked witch. "
But it does not happen like that.
Another thing really specific to the "Oz magician" in my opinion, is that, all the most heroic and wise characters, even the bad guys, are women.
I started to realize when I showed "Star Wars" to my daughter, many years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
He was only three years old at the time.
He was not invited to the projection. He was too young for that.
But he was the second child, and the level of supervision had dropped.
So he entered the room, and it scored it as a mother teaches his child, and I do not think he understood what was going on, but he escaned.
And I wonder what he has impregnated.
Is it internalizing the themes of courage, perseverance and loyalty?
Or does it internalize that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government?
He interiorizes the fact that there are only boys in the universe except the Aunt Beru, and of course this princess, who is really cool, but who only wait for almost all the movie for To finally be able to reward the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, what he does by the magic that he has birth?
Let's compare that at the "Oz magician" of 1939.
How does Dorothy win in the movie?
Being friends with everyone and being a leader.
This is the kind of people in which I would like to raise my children - Oz, is not it? - And not a world of guys who fight, where is currently found.
Why is there so strength - strength with a capital F - in the movies we do for our children and so little yellow brick road?
There is a lot of literature on the impact that the guys-and violence movies have on girls, and you should read what is said. It's very enlightening.
I did not read as much on how boys react to that.
I know of experience that Princess Leia does not give the adequate context that could have been useful for navigating the adult world that is mixed.
There was this moment of the first kiss where I really expected to see the end credits because it's the end of a movie, is not it?
I accomplished my quest, I had the girl.
Why are you still here?
I do not know what to do there.
The films are very oriented on the victory against the villain and receive his reward, and there is not much room for other relationships or other adventures.
Due, if you're a boy, you're a stubborn animal, and if you're a girl, you have to put your warrior costume.
There are many exceptions, and I will defend the princesses from Disney while saying.
But they send a message to the boys that they are not the target audience.
They do a great job to show girls how to defend themselves with the patriarchy, but they do not particularly show boys how they are supposed to defend against this patriarchy.
There are no models for them.
And we also have great women who write new stories for our children, and also realistic and charming that Hermione and Katniss are, they are still war films.
And of course, the most prosperous studio of all times goes out classic after classic, each of them telling the course of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or A man and his son, or two men who raise a little girl.
Until, as many of you think, this year they come out "rebellious".
I recommend it to each of you. It is currently available in VOD.
Do you remember what critics said when "rebellious" came out?
Ah, I can not believe Pixar made a princess film.
He is very good. Do not stop that.
So, almost none of these films passes the Bechdel test.
I do not know if you have heard about it.
It is not yet well known, but maybe today we will create a movement.
Alison Bechdel is a cartoon designer, and in the mid-1980s she recorded this conversation she had with a friend on the evaluation of the films they had seen.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions to ask yourself: there is more than one character in the film that is feminin and who has text?
So try to reach this level.
And do these women talk to some time in the movie?
Do their conversation go around something other than the man they love both?
OK? Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Two women who exist and discuss stuff.
It exists. I have already seen that, and yet I see it very rarely in the films we know and love.
This week I went to see a high-invoice film, "Argo".
We are talking about Oscar, it's carton at the box office, the very definition of a Hollywood super production.
It fails all the same with Bechdel's test.
And I think it should not, because a good part of the movie, I do not know if you saw it, but a good part of the film is happening in an embassy where men and women hide during the hostage crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men with deep conversations, dominated by frustration, in this hiding place, and one of the great moments for one of the actresses is to open a door and say, "You come to bed, Dear ?"
That's Hollywood.
Let's take a look at the numbers.
In 2011, the 100 most popular films, in your opinion, how many have a woman as a main character?
Eleven. Not bad.
This is not the same percentage as the number of women we have just elected at Congress, so it's okay.
But there is a figure that is bigger than that will surprise this room.
Last year, the New York Times published a study conducted by the government.
This is what she says.
One in five women in the United States says he has been sexually assaulted at a time of his life.
Well, I do not think it's the fault of consumer entertainment.
I do not think that children's films are there for something.
I do not even think that clips or pornography have a direct relationship with that, but there is something wrong, and when I hear these statistics, one of the things I think is that it's a lot of sexual abusers .
Who are these men? What do they learn?
What do they fail to learn?
Are they impregnating history that the hero's job is to overcome the villain by violence and then take his reward, who is a woman who has no friends and who does not speak?
Are we implemented this story?
You know, as a parent who has the privilege of raising a girl like you who do the same thing, we find this world and these very disturbing statistics and we want to prepare them.
We have tools at our disposal such as the "Girl Power", and we hope that it will help, but I wonder, is the "Girl Power" will subery to protect them if, at the same time, actively Or passive, we train our sons to maintain their "Boy Power"?
My idea is that our TV program is a way to do something very important, and I am particularly addressing fathers here.
I think we need to show our sons a new definition of manhood.
The definition of manhood is already spilling.
You had to read how the new economy reverses the roles of the one who gains money and the one who takes care of the family.
Everything is bunkaled.
Our sons will have to find a way to adapt to that, to a new relationship with others and I think we have to show them, by example, how true a guy is the one who trusts his Sisters and respects them, and wants to be part of their team, and stands against the real wicked, who are the men who mistreat women.
And I think our role in this TV programming is to look for these movies that pass the Bechdel test, if we come to find them, and to look for the heroines that are there, who show courage, who gather people, and To encourage our sons to identify with these heroines and to say, "I want to be part of their team," because they will be part of their team.
When I asked my daughter his favorite character of "Star Wars", you know what she said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do they have in common?
Maybe there is more than the scintillating dress.
I think these people are experts.
In my opinion, it's the two people of the film who know more than others, and they like to share their knowledge with others to help them reach their potential.
These are leaders.
I like this kind of quest for my daughter, and I love this kind of quest for my son.
I want more quests like that.
I want less quests where we tell my son, "Go and fight alone," And more quests where he sees it's his duty to join a team, perhaps a team led by women, for Help others get better and be better people, like the Wizard of Oz.
Thank you.
I would like to tell you a story about a kid from a small town.
I do not know his name, but I know his story well.
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
His village is close to Mogadishu.
Drought plunged the small village into poverty and led it on the edge of famine.
Do not hope nothing about his life there, he leaves his village for the big city, for Mogadishcio, capital of Somalia.
Once there there, there is no opportunity, no work, no outlet.
He ends up settler in a tent camp in the suburbs of Mogadishu.
A year is happening and always nothing.
One day, a well-made man approaches him and offers him to offer him lunch, then dinner, then breakfast.
He then meets this group of dynamic people who helps him get out.
It gives him a little money to buy new clothes, money to send to his family in the country.
We present it to a young woman.
He ends up marrying.
He begins a new life.
He finally has a goal in life.
Then a beautiful day in Mogadishcio, under a sky of a azure blue, a trapped car explodes.
The gamin of the village that dreamed of the big city was the Kamikaze responsible for this act, and this group of people full of dynamism it was al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to the Al-Qaeda group.
So, how is it a small villager who only seeks to succeed in the big city ends up exploding?
He was waiting.
In the process of waiting for an opportunity, waiting to build his future, waiting to find a way out, and this was the first thing that was present.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we will call his waiting situation.
And its story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It is the history of urban youth, unemployed and marginalized, the one that triggers riots in Johannesburg, riots in London, the one that tries to get out of this waiting situation.
For young people, the promise of the big city, the dream of the big city is that of opportunities, work, wealth, but young people do not take advantage of the prosperity of their city.
Often, they are young people who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three out of five city dwellers will be under 18 years old.
If we do not imply young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them with opportunities, this waiting situation, this gateway to terrorism, violence and organized crime, will be history our cities.
In my hometown, Mogadishcio, 70% of young people suffer from unemployment.
70% do not have work, do not go to school.
They are there, to do nothing.
I went back to Mogadishcio last month, and I visited Madina Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember remaining standing in front of this hospital riddled with bullets thinking, and if I had never gone?
If I had been forced to stay in this same waiting situation?
Would I have become a terrorist?
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in Mogadishu that month was in truth to organize a young leaders and entrepreneurs' summit.
I gathered some 90 young Somali leaders.
We have reflected together with solutions to the major challenges facing their city.
One of the young men in the room was named Aden.
He had graduated from the University of Mogadishu.
But there were no jobs, no opportunities.
I remember that he told me, because he was a young graduate, unemployed and frustrated, he represented the perfect target to be recruited by Al-Shabaab and other terrorist organizations.
They were looking for people like him.
But his story took another turning point.
In Mogadishu, the biggest obstacle to go from a point to a point B is the roads.
Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road network, and a motorcycle is the easiest way to get around.
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.
He launched a motorcycle company.
He started to rent these motorcycles to local residents who could not normally afford.
He bought ten motorcycles with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is to grow by buying several hundreds in the next three years.
What makes this story different?
What makes his story different?
I think it's his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity.
It is the spirit of entrepreneurship, and I think entrepreneurship can be the most powerful cure against the waiting situation.
It gives young people the means to be the creators of these same opportunities they seek so desperately.
And we can train young people to become entrepreneurs.
I will tell you the story of another young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
He helped me train some young people at the top of entrepreneurship to show an innovative spirit and learn to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
In fact, it is the first florist that Mogadishcio has experienced in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed's arrival, if you wanted flowers to your wedding, you had to use plastic bouquets shipped from abroad.
If you were asking someone "that she is the last time you saw fresh flowers? For many of those who have experienced the civil war, the answer would be "never. »
So Mohamed saw there an opportunity.
He founded a landscape and floral composition planning company.
It establishes a farm outside Mogadishu, where he made tulips and lily flowers, who, according to him, could withstand the hard climate of Mogadishu.
And he began to deliver flowers to weddings, to develop gardens in houses and commercial sites across the city, and now he worked on the project of the first public garden of Mogadishu in 22 years.
There is no public garden in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a space where families and young people will be able to meet, and, as he says, mope the perfume of these proverbial roses.
By the way, it does not grow roses because they need far too much water.
The first step is to inspire young people, and in this room, Mohamed's presence really had a profound impact on young people.
They had never really thought of rising their own business.
They had thought of working for an NGO, working for the government, but its history, its innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a source of opportunities.
He allowed them to believe in their potential for entrepreneurs, in their power to change things.
At the end of the day, they were able to propose innovative solutions to some of the major challenges facing their city.
They found enterprise solutions to local problems.
Thus, inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurship is really a big step, but young people need capital to realize their ideas.
They need counselors and mentors to guide them in the development and launch of their projects.
Give youth the resources they need, give them the support needed to move from the idea to creation, and you will have created a catalyst for urban growth.
In my opinion, entrepreneurship is more than just climbing a business.
It's an impact on society.
Mohamed does not just sell flowers.
He also sells hope.
His Peace Park as he calls him, once completed, will truly turn the eyes from people on their city.
Aden hired street kids to help him rent and maintain motorcycles.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the waiting situation.
These young entrepreneurs have a huge impact on their cities.
My suggestion is, transforming young people into entrepreneurs, incubate and feed their innovative innovation capacity, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than trapped cars and waiting situations.
Thank you.
When I was a child, I grew up in Maine, I liked to look for sandy dollars on the beaches of Maine, because my parents told me that it would be lucky.
You know, these shells are hard to find.
They are covered with sand. They are hard to spot.
But over time, I got used to looking for them.
I started recognizing forms and models that helped me gather them.
It has evolved into a passion for discovery, a love for the past and archeology.
Finally, when I started studying Egyptology, I realized that seeing the naked eye was not enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my tiny beach of Maine turned into a beach of about 1300 kilometers long near the Nile, and my sand dollars had the size of cities.
That's what really brought me to use satellite imaging.
To be able to trace the past, I knew I would have to see things differently.
I want to show you how we see differently thanks to the infrared.
This site, located east of the Egyptian delta named Bendix.
At a glance, the site is brown, but under infrared and after treatment with artificial colors, the site suddenly appears in bright pink.
What you see are in fact the chemical transformations of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activity of the ancient Egyptians.
What I want to share with you today is the way satellite data has been used to find an ancient Egyptian city, called itjtawy, missing for thousands of years.
Itjtawi was the capital of ancient Egypt for more than four hundred years, at a time called the worshiking and four thousand years old.
This place is located in the city of Faiyum in Egypt and it is very important because in the way, a great Renaissance had transformed the art, architecture and religion of ancient Egypt.
Egyptologists had always presumed that Etjtawy was somewhere between the pyramids of the two kings having built it, as shown by red circles, somewhere within this huge flood bed.
This area is vast, it measures about 6.5 kilometers out of 5.
The Nile passed near the city of Itjtawy, and as it evolved, changed and moved east, it ended up recovering the city.
How to find a city engulfed under a vast landscape?
Try random would be tantamount to search for a needle in a hay boot, blindfolded and baseball gloves.
What we did is used the topographic data of NASA to establish a site map; The differences are very subtle.
We managed to go back to the origins of the flow of Nile
And what is even more interesting is that you can see in detail this area slightly elevated and delimited by this circle; We thought it could be the location of the city of Itjtawy.
With Egyptian scientists, we undertook the corottage, which you see here.
When I say drilling, it's like ice core, but there were no layers testifying to climate change but human occupation.
At five meters deep, under a thick layer of mud, was a dense layer of pottery.
This shows that iTjtawy's probable location, five meters deep, layers testify to human occupation for hundreds of years and date from the empire way, exactly as we had assumed.
We also found cut stones, corneline, quartz, agate, which showed that a jeweler's workshop was here.
At first glance, it does not jump to the eyes, but when you think of the most used jewelry stones at the time of the way Empire, it was those.
So we have here a dense layer of human occupation dating from the means empire.
We also prove the existence of a luxury jewelery workshop showing that the city that was here had to be very important.
We do not know yet if it was ITJTAWY, but we will soon come back to the scene.
What is more important again is that we have funds to teach young Egyptians to handle satellite technology so that they can also contribute to great discoveries.
I conclude with my favorite citation of the means Empire, probably written in Itjtawy four thousand years ago.
"The sharing of knowledge is the best vocation.
There is nothing comparable on earth. »
It turns out that TED was not founded in 1984 of our era.
The creation of ideas actually started in 1984 before J.-C in a liabmed city for some time and found from above.
This searches in perspective the discovery of the shells on the shore.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan as a daughter of a calligrapher, one of the moments I cherished the most is my mother showing me the beauty and form of Chinese characters.
Since then, I have always been fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a stranger, it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of China.
In recent years, I wondered if I could slaughter this wall, so that anyone, who would like to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about the usefulness of a new and quick method to learn Chinese.
Since I have five years, I learned to draw every line for each character in order.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it would be necessary to make quick and easy.
A Chinese scholar would include 20,000 characters.
We only need 1000 for the current language.
The first 200 make it possible to understand 40% of the basic literature - enough to read the signs of the road, the restaurant menu, to understand the basic idea of ​​websites or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight characters to show you how the method works.
Are you ready ?
Open your mouth as large as possible until it is square.
You have a mouth.
Here is a person who walks.
Nobody.
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on each side, as if she screamed frantically, "help me! I take fire! - The symbol comes from the shape of a flame, but I like to see it like that. It's like you want.
This is a tree.
Tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a Far West Saloon door.
I call these eight characters of the radicals.
These are the bricks to create more characters.
A person.
If someone walks behind, it means "follow".
As the saying does, two is, three is a crowd.
If a person opens his arms, then that person says, "it was great like that. »
If the person is in the mouth is that she is trapped.
It's a prisoner, like Jonah in the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees, it's a wood.
Three trees, we have a forest.
A board under the tree, and we have the foundation.
A mouth above the tree, and it's "stupid".
Easy to memorize, since talking to a tree is stupid enough.
Do you remember fire?
Two fires together, and it is very hot.
Three fires together, it's a lot of flames.
Turn on the fire under both trees, and it burns.
For us, the sun is a source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperity.
Three suns, it's sparks.
The sun and the moon together, it's the shine.
It also means tomorrow, after a day and one night.
The sun rises above the horizon. Dawn.
A door. A board in the door is a lock.
A mouth in the door is asking questions.
Knock Knock. Someone is there ?
This person sneaks out, runs away, escapes.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, it's an argument.
Three women together, attention is adultery.
So we saw almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radicals allow you to build 32.
The next eight characters will build 32 more.
So with very little effort, you can learn 200 characters, like a Chinese child of 8 years.
So after the characters, we build sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain fire. It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the country of the rising sun.
It is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun, with its origin, we have Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese.
The character on the left is two mountains one above the other.
In the old China, it meant exile, because the Chinese emperors put their enemies in exile beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile means going out.
A mouth that indicates where to go out is an output.
That's a slide that reminds me that I have to stop talking and going down from the scene. Thank you.
